### What are TCP Flags?

TCP flags are special markers in network messages (packets) that help computers talk to each other over the internet. They signal how a conversation should start, end, or if there are any special instructions.

### Main TCP Flags and What They Mean

#### 1. **SYN (Synchronize)**
- **Think of it as:** “Can we start talking?”
- **Used for:** Starting a connection between two computers.

#### 2. **ACK (Acknowledgment)**
- **Think of it as:** “Okay, I got your message.”
- **Used for:** Letting the other computer know a message was received.

#### 3. **FIN (Finish)**
- **Think of it as:** “I’m done talking.”
- **Used for:** Ending a conversation.

#### 4. **RST (Reset)**
- **Think of it as:** “Something went wrong, let’s stop!”
- **Used for:** Forcing a connection to close immediately.

#### 5. **PSH (Push)**
- **Think of it as:** “Send this message right now!”
- **Used for:** Telling the computer to pass data to the application immediately.

#### 6. **URG (Urgent)**
- **Think of it as:** “This is very important, handle it first!”
- **Used for:** Marking some data as urgent.

### Example: How Two Computers Start Talking

1. **Computer A:** Sends a SYN (“Can we start talking?”)
2. **Computer B:** Replies with SYN + ACK (“Yes, and I heard you.”)
3. **Computer A:** Sends ACK (“Great, let’s talk!”)
4. **Now they can send data back and forth.**

### Summary Table

| Flag | Simple Meaning         | Real Use                        |
|------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| SYN  | Start talking         | Begin a connection              |
| ACK  | Got your message      | Confirm receipt of packets      |
| FIN  | I’m done              | Gracefully end connection       |
| RST  | Stop everything!      | Abort connection immediately    |
| PSH  | Send NOW!             | Push data to application        |
| URG  | Urgent!               | Urgent data in the message      |

Certainly! Here’s a simple, CEH v13-focused explanation of each concept:

---

### 1. **Packet Fragmentation**

**In Networking:**  
When sending large data over the internet, it’s broken into small pieces called “packets.” If a network can’t handle big packets, they get chopped into even smaller “fragments” to fit through.

**CEH v13 Relevance:**  
Hackers can use fragmentation to sneak malicious data past security devices, hoping the “pieces” aren’t put back together and inspected properly by firewalls or IDS/IPS.

---

### 2. **Source Routing**

**In Networking:**  
Source routing lets the sender specify the exact path a data packet should take through the network, instead of letting routers pick the best route.

**CEH v13 Relevance:**  
Attackers might use source routing to bypass security systems, choosing paths that avoid firewalls or monitoring devices.

---

### 3. **Proxy Server**

**In Networking:**  
A proxy server sits between your computer and the internet. It forwards your requests and responses, hiding your identity or filtering content.

**CEH v13 Relevance:**  
Proxies can be used for privacy, bypassing internet restrictions, or hiding an attacker’s real source. Security professionals should understand how proxies can help or hinder investigations.

| Concept             | Analogy                         | Why it matters in CEH v13              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Packet Fragmentation| Breaking a big box into small ones | Can hide attacks from security tools  |
| Source Routing      | Telling the post office the route  | Can bypass security devices           |
| Proxy Server        | Receptionist/middleman             | Can hide identity, bypass blocks      |
