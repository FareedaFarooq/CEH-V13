### What are TCP Flags?

TCP flags are special markers in network messages (packets) that help computers talk to each other over the internet. They signal how a conversation should start, end, or if there are any special instructions.

### Main TCP Flags and What They Mean

#### 1. **SYN (Synchronize)**
- **Think of it as:** “Can we start talking?”
- **Used for:** Starting a connection between two computers.

#### 2. **ACK (Acknowledgment)**
- **Think of it as:** “Okay, I got your message.”
- **Used for:** Letting the other computer know a message was received.

#### 3. **FIN (Finish)**
- **Think of it as:** “I’m done talking.”
- **Used for:** Ending a conversation.

#### 4. **RST (Reset)**
- **Think of it as:** “Something went wrong, let’s stop!”
- **Used for:** Forcing a connection to close immediately.

#### 5. **PSH (Push)**
- **Think of it as:** “Send this message right now!”
- **Used for:** Telling the computer to pass data to the application immediately.

#### 6. **URG (Urgent)**
- **Think of it as:** “This is very important, handle it first!”
- **Used for:** Marking some data as urgent.

### Example: How Two Computers Start Talking

1. **Computer A:** Sends a SYN (“Can we start talking?”)
2. **Computer B:** Replies with SYN + ACK (“Yes, and I heard you.”)
3. **Computer A:** Sends ACK (“Great, let’s talk!”)
4. **Now they can send data back and forth.**
