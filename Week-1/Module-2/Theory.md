- **Reconnaissance**:  
  Initial phase of cyber operations; collecting info about a target.

---

- **Types of Reconnaissance**:
  - *Passive*: Gathering info without direct interaction (e.g., social media, public records).
  - *Active*: Directly engaging target systems (e.g., port scanning).

---

- **Google Dorks**:  
  Using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive data or vulnerable files exposed online.

---

- **AI Used by Browsers & OSINT Suitability**:
  - *Google Chrome*: Google Gemini/Assistant (general AI features).
  - *Microsoft Edge*: Copilot (OpenAI-based, integrated for Bing search).
  - *Mozilla Firefox*: No built-in AI, uses plugins/extensions.
  - *Brave*: Leo (mix of Llama/OpenAI models).
  - *Best for OSINT*: Chrome (due to extensive plugins/addons for OSINT and integration with Google search).

---

- **Use of Shell GPT**:  
  Interact with ChatGPT/OpenAI models directly in the terminal for research, automation, or scripting tasks.

---

- **RIRs (Regional Internet Registries)**:  
  Organizations managing IP address allocation by region:
  - *ARIN* (North America)
  - *RIPE NCC* (Europe, Middle East, parts of Central Asia)
  - *APNIC* (Asia Pacific)
  - *LACNIC* (Latin America, Caribbean)
  - *AFRINIC* (Africa)

---

- **DNS (Domain Name System) & Subdomains**:
  - *DNS*: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
  - *Subdomains*: Prefixes to main domain (e.g., `mail.example.com`)—often used for OSINT to reveal additional services.

---

- **Archive.org**:  
  The Wayback Machine archives snapshots of websites over time—useful for viewing historical data or deleted pages.

---

- **Dark Web**:  
  Part of the internet not indexed by standard search engines, accessed via special tools (e.g., Tor); often used for anonymous activities.

---

- **Traceroute**:
  - *Default*: Uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request to trace network path.
  - *TCP/UDP*: Traceroute can use TCP or UDP packets to bypass ICMP filtering/firewalls or test specific ports.
 ---

- **Dig Command**:
  - The dig command (Domain Information Groper) is a network administration command-line tool used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers. It helps you look up DNS records for a domain, troubleshoot DNS issues, and obtain information about domains.
